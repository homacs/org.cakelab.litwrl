<title>Life in the Woods Renaissance - Getting Started</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>
Due to changes to hunger mechanics and food properties, it might
get a bit tough to get started if you try to play it the usual
vanilla Minecraft style. Thus, I've added a brief guide
on those two topics. At the end of this guide is also a list with
<a href="#References">references</a> to documentation for further reading you should look into
later on when you have proceeded a bit in the game. There are 
definitely other things you will need (such as backpacks or 
cooking pot) or you would like to try out (such as bee keeping
or the vegan recipes).

<h2>Hunger</h2>
<p>Food provides less saturation than in vanilla Minecraft and you 
get hungry quicker depending on your activity. 
</p>
<h3>Food Value</h3>
<p>The saturation provided by certain food depends on its 
food value. You can see the value of food in your inventory 
when hovering the mouse over it. 
</p>
<h3>Effects from Hunger and Eating</h3>
<p>
Health regeneration is slower, the more hungry you are but
you regenerate health even if you have lost more than three chunks.
Also, you will get generally slower and weaker the more hungry you are.
When your hunger bar is empty you finally die instantly.
</p>
<p>
After you have eaten a meal you get the <em>Well Fed</em> bonus effect 
which regenerates your health up-to 30% faster. The effect lasts
longer the larger the meal was and is displayed as yellow border
around the icons in your hunger bar.

<h2>Naturally Growing Food</h2>
<p>When you spawn fresh, you should start soon to collect food 
from natural resources and in some biomes, animals are rare. 
Besides the vanilla Minecraft fruits/vegetables/mushrooms 
there are different fruits and berries etc. to eat.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Fruits of Naturally Grown Bushes or Plants</dt>
<dd>Punch the plants to collect up-to three random fruits/vegetables 
of different types each. Bushes, cacti and 
other plants propagate naturally the same way as mushrooms do.</dd>
<dt>Mushrooms</dt>
<dd>You can eat vanilla mushrooms if you cook them in a furnace. 
In some biomes, those are the only food resource.</dd>
<dt>Fruits of Trees</dt>
<dd>Right click to harvest a fruit. Another young fruit will appear 
at the same spot which needs to grow before harvesting again. You 
can also punch the fruit, to remove and receive that fruit from 
the tree.</dd>

<h2>Farming</h2>
<h3>Collecting Seeds</h3>
You cannot get seeds from punching grass!
<dl>
<dt>Wheat</dt>
<dd>You need an iron or better hoe (wood hoes do not exist). Right click 
with the hoe on grass blocks (not close to water) will 
give you seeds to grow wheat. Please note, that the hoe looses 
durability very quick!<dd>
<dt>Vegetables, Berries, etc.</dt>
<dd>You get seeds from fruits/vegetables by crafting (one seed for one fruit), 
the same way as with melons or pumpkins.</dd>
<dt>Fruits of Trees</dt>
<dd>Saplings for fruit trees are crafted from a common oak sapling plus a fruit.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Planting</h3>
<h4>Conditions</h4>
<p>Crops need daylight to grow (not torches). Plants grow with 
different speed or not at all depending on the biome and the 
farmland they are planted on. Seeds may even pop out of the earth if their 
conditions are not met. Hover with your mouse over 
the seed in your inventory to get information about the conditions 
needed. 
</p>
<h4>Farmland</h4>
<p>Seeds need farmland to grow a plant.
There are two different types of farmland:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Farmland">Vanilla Minecraft Farmland</a></dt>
<dd>The common farmland you know from Minecraft already with the same properties.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/jaquadro/GardenCollection/wiki/Tilled-Garden-Soil">Tilled Garden Soil</a></dt>
<dd>This type of farmland increases growing speed, is self-hydrating and resistant against trampeling. 
It is crafted from dirt and compost.</dd> 
</dl>
<h3>Harvesting</h3>
<p>
To harvest your crops (wheat/vegetables/berries) you <em>right click</em> them. 
This harvests the fruit, vegetable or whatever but the plant remains 
planted.
</p>
<p>
You cannot harvest a plant which is immature. You can see its grown 
state in the lower right corner of the screen when looking at the plant.
