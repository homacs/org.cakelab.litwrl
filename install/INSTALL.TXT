This is the install package of the Life in the Woods 
Renaissance Launcher.

This package contains the platform independent jar
of the launcher and installation scripts for each
supported platform.

For further details refer to the launcher's User Manual

   http://homac.cakelab.org/projects/litwrl/manual/



To install the launcher you have to

  0. have Java 7 or higher installed
  1. unzip this package
  2. execute installation script to create shortcut
  3. copy shortcut to desktop (or anywhere else)

Details below.



0. INSTALL JAVA
===============
In order to run Minecraft (and Life in the Woods 
Renaissance) you need "Oracle" Java SE 7 (aka Java 1.7) 
or higher (higher is better). When downloading chose either
the JDK or JRE package.

Download Java here:

  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
 
Respective here (if above link does not work):

  http://java.oracle.com/

 
Windows users get an installer.

Easiest way for Ubuntu/Debian users are the WEB UPD8 PPA packages, see:
 http://www.webupd8.org/2012/01/install-oracle-java-jdk-7-in-ubuntu-via.html



1. UNZIP THE PACKAGE
====================

In order to install the launcher you have to unzip
this package. Unzip the contents of the zip file to
a location where you want to install the launcher.


a. Windows & Mac
----------------
	On Windows and Mac just drag and drop the contents of the package 
	to a location on your file system where you would like the
	launcher to be installed.

b. Linux
--------
In most linux distributions a double click on the package will open an
archiver application and you can drag and drop the contents on your file
system. 

If this does not work then open a shell and execute the commands:

	sudo apt-get install zip
	unzip <package>



2. INSTALL SCRIPTS
==================
The installation scripts just create a desktop shortcut
in the unzipped folder. The shortcut is
necessary to reliably start the launcher with Java 7 or 
higher. 

Usually, a double click on

	<your-platform>/install[.bat|.command|.sh]

should do the trick. Otherwise look below.




a. WINDOWS
----------

Double click on 

    windows\install.bat


!If nothing happens, then open the command prompt and execute 
the commands

    cd <path-to-the-folder-you-have-unzipped>
    windows\install.bat




b: MAC OS
---------

Double click on and follow the instructions given in the terminal window.

	mac/install.command


	
If nothing happens then follow these steps:
	1. open a shell (terminal window)
	2. navigate to the folder you have unzipped (i.e.: cd <unzipped folder>)
	3. type and execute the command: 
		> bash
		> . mac/install.command
	


c. Linux
--------

Double click on

	install-ubuntu.sh
	

	
If nothing happens, then open a shell and execute the 
commands:

	> /bin/bash
	> cd <path-to-the-folder-you-have-unzipped>
	> . install-ubuntu.sh



3. SHORTCUT ON DESKTOP
======================
A shortcut (i.e. App Bundle in case of MacOS) has been created on
your Desktop by the installation script.

The shortcut (Bundle) can be copied/moved to any location in your 
file system (or you can leave it on your desktop).

However, on Windows and Linux, you have absolute paths. If you move 
the unzipped folder to a new location or you have updated Java, you 
have to run the install script again to 
create a new shortcut.
