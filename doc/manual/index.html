		<p>This is the user manual of the <a href="../index.html">launcher</a> for 
			<a href="http://lifeinthewoods.ca">Life in the Woods: Renaissance</a>. The launcher was developed to
			ease installation and update of the mod-pack and addons like shaders. However, the launcher is not 
			necessary to run Life in the Woods Renaissance. You can also download and install the mod-pack manually
			from the <a href="http://lifeinthewoods.ca">web-site</a>.

		<h1 id="Installation">Installation</h1>
		<p>This section will guide you through the installation of the launcher. The launcher requires Java SE 
		1.7 minimum and comes in a package with installation scripts for all supported platforms 
		(Windows/MacOS/Linux).
		</p>
		<h2 id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
		<p>Minimum requirement for the mod-pack is <b>Oracle Java SE 1.8</b> either the JDK (<b>required on Mac</b>) 
			or the JRE package. 
			It is also recommended by Mojang to use the latest Java version for better performance.
			Download Java 1.8 <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">here</a>. 
			In case that link is no longer valid go <a href="http://java.oracle.com/">here</a> and 
			navigate to Java SE (which means "Standard Edition").
		</p>
		<p>
		Easiest way for Ubuntu/Debian users are the WEB UPD8 PPA packages, see:
		<a href="http://www.webupd8.org/2012/01/install-oracle-java-jdk-7-in-ubuntu-via.html">WEB UPD8</a>
		</p>
		
		<b>Important notes:</b>
		<ul>
		<li>If you are running a 64bit architecture, then you have to have a 64bit Java as well!</li>
		<li>Oracle is necessary: Neither the Launcher nor Minecraft will run properly 
			with non-oracle Java environments such as OpenJDK or Apple Java.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>However, the installation scripts will check first if all those requirements are met.</p>
		<h2 id="Download">Download</h2>
		<p>The installation package of the launcher can be found 
		<a href="http://lifeinthewoods.ca/litwr/downloads/LifeInTheWoodsRenaissanceLauncher.zip">here</a>. 
		If you consider a manual install of the mod-pack only, visit the download page on the 
		<a href="http://lifeinthewoods.ca/downloads.html">official web-site</a> of Life in the Woods Renaissance.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Windows">Windows</h2>
		<p>In order to install the launcher you have to perform the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
		<li><b>Unzip the downloaded installation package</b> (see <a href="#Download">Download</a>) 
			to a folder, where you want the launcher to be installed.</li>
		<li><b>Run the installation script <code>windows\install.bat</code></b>. You can 
			start the installation script with a double click. The installation 
			script checks if you have a suitable Java installation and creates 
			a shortcut on your desktop, that is all. You can move the shortcut to 
			any location you like.</li>
		</ol>
		<h2 id="MacOS">MacOS</h2>
		<p>In order to install the launcher you have to perform the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
		<li><b>Unzip the downloaded installation package</b> (see <a href="#Download">Download</a>) 
			to a temporary folder.</li>
		<li><b>Run the installation script <code>mac/install.command</code></b>. You can 
			start the installation script with a double click. If that does not work for 
			you, then start the Terminal application (command line), navigate inside the unzipped folder,
			and execute <code>chmod +x mac/install.command && mac/install.command</code>. The installation 
			script checks if you have a suitable Java installation and creates 
			an Application Bundle with the launcher on your desktop, that is all. You can move the Application Bundle to 
			any location you want.</li>
		<li><b>Remove the unzipped folder</b> when you are done. The launcher 
			has been copied to the Application Bundle and the unzipped folder is no longer needed.
		</ol>
		<h2 id="Linux">Linux</h2>
		<ol>
		<li><b>Unzip the downloaded installation package</b> (see <a href="#Download">Download</a>) 
			to a folder, where you want the launcher to be installed.</li>
		<li><b>Run the installation script <code>linux/install.sh</code></b>. You can 
			start the installation script with a double click. If that does not work for 
			you, then start a shell (e.g. xterm), navigate inside the unzipped folder,
			and execute <code>chmod +x linux/install.sh && linux/install.sh</code>. The installation 
			script checks if you have a suitable Java installation and creates 
			a desktop link in the top-level directory of the unzipped folder. This link should
			be compatible with most window managers of debian derivates (e.g. Ubuntu).
			You can move the desktop link to any location you like (e.g. menu or toolbar).</li>
		</ol>
		<h2 id="PlatformIndependent">Platform Independent</h2>
		<p>
		The installation package contains the launcher's Java archive (<code>litwrl.jar</code>). 
		If the above installation scripts did not work for you, then you can always start the launcher with the command:<br/>
		</p>
		<pre>
		> java -jar litwrl.jar
		</pre>
		<p>
		Make sure you have at least Oracle Java SE 1.8 installed (see <a href="#Prerequisites">Prerequisites</a>).
		</p>
		<h1 id="Application">Application</h1>
		<h2 id="Start">Start</h2>
		<p>When you start the launcher you may experience a short delay of 1-2 seconds without 
			a visual feedback until the graphical user interface (GUI) shows up.
		</p>
		<p> Especially during the first 
			start the launcher will then need some time to initialise its local directory 
			(see Section <a href="#Directories">Directories</a>). 
			This will be indicated with the text <em>"initialising .."</em> on the button in 
			the center of the footer in the GUI (see Section <a href="#Interface">User Interface</a>).
		</p>
		<h2 id="Interface">User Interface</h2>
		<p>The GUI of the launcher is basically subdivided into a header, a center and a footer.</p>
		<dl>
		<dt>Header</dt>
		<dd>The header, which also shows the LitWR logo, allows you to switch between the different tabs, 
		namely <em>News</em>, <em>Config</em>, <em>Log</em>, <em>Credits</em> and <em>?</em> (the help page).
		</dd>
		<dt>Center</dt>
		<dd>The center shows the content of the selected tab. In the Figure you see 
		the content of the selected tab <em>News</em>. 
		<dt>Footer</dt>
		<dd>The footer contains (from left to right) the <em>progress bar</em>, the <em>Install/Play</em> button and the <em>variant selector</em>.
		The Install/Play button is used to start an installation/upgrade of a game and to start an installed game. The variant selector is used to select
		one of the two variants of Life in the Woods Renaissance (see Section <a href="#GameVariant">Game Variant</a> for details).
		</dd>
		</dl>
		<div align="center"><img src="images/news.png"/></div>		
		<h2>Tab Sheets</h2>
		<p>The GUI provides the following tab sheets:</p>
		<dl>
		<dt>News</dt>
		<dd>The launcher will always start with the News tab selected to show you recent news related to Life in the Woods Renaissance.</dd>
		<dt>Config</dt>
		<dd>The configuration page allows you to configure your game installation (see Section <a href="#Configuration">Configuration</a>).</dd>
		<dt>Log</dt>
		<dd>The <em>Log</em> tab shows you messages of the launcher which provide detailed information about ongoing tasks. This 
		tab will be automatically opened during installation or upgrade to give more feedback about what's actually going on. 
		However, you can always switch to another tab.</dd>
		<dt>Credits</dt>
		<dd>This tab provides links to all the organisations and people somehow 
			involved in the creation of Life in the Woods Renaissance or related components, artwork etc..</dd>
		<dt>? (Help Page)</dt>
		<dd>This tab contains a brief getting started guide for newcomers and links 
			to available documentation for all mods which alter the game play.</dd>
		</dl>
		<h1 id="Directories">Directories</h1>
		<p>This sections explains which directories are used by the 
		launcher on your system and where you can find things you know from Minecraft.</p>
		<dl>
		<dt>Launcher Bootstrap Directory</dt>
		<dd>This is the directory, you have originally unzipped from the installation package you have downloaded. 
		Respective on MacOS this is the Application Bundle that was created by the installation script. 
		The bootstrap directory contains a copy of the launcher which is used to boot 
		into the latest version of the launcher. So, when you have just downloaded the launcher, the bootstrap 
		and the latest version of the launcher will be the same. With updates this will change.
		</dd>
		<dt>Launcher Local Directory (<code>$HOME/.litwrl</code>)</dt>
		<dd>The local directory is located in your home directory (Windows: <code>C:\Users\&lt;login&gt;\.litwrl</code>, MacOS: <code>/Users/&lt;login&gt;/.litwrl</code>, Linux: <code>/home/&lt;login&gt;/.litwrl</code>). 
			The local directory contains almost everything the launcher needs to operate 
			and to run Life in the Woods Renaissance.
			<ul>
			<li><code>litwrl.cfg</code>: Configuration file of the launcher.</li>
			<li><code>litwrl.log</code>: Log file of the launcher, with the same contents shown in <em>Log</em> tab.</li>
			<li><code>repository</code>: Local cache of mod-pack information (dependencies, versions, etc.) and data (downloaded files). 
				It also contains the latest version of the launcher itself.</li>
			<li><code>games</code>: This directory contains the modded game installations for Life in the Woods Renaissance. 
			For example if you have installed Life in the Woods Renaissance in variant Basic, 
			then this directory will contain a game directory <code>LitWR.Basic</code> with all mods and shader etc. in it. 
			<li><code>minecraft</code> (optional): By default, the launcher will create its own Minecraft installation in its Local Directory. You can change that on the <em>Config</em> tab.
			</ul>
		</dd>
		<dt>Minecraft Working Directory</dt>
		<dd>By default, the launcher will create its own installation of Minecraft in its Local Directory (see above). 
			You can also choose to use your own minecraft installation on the <em>Config</em> tab 
			(see <a href="#Configuration">Configuration</a>).
		</dd>
		<dt>Game Directory</dt>
		<dd>The game directory was already mentioned under Launcher Local Directory. 
			Game directories created by the launcher are located in the subdirectory <code>games</code> 
			in the launchers local directory. A game directory contains <code>mods</code>, 
			<code>configs</code>, <code>saves</code>, <code>screenshots</code>, 
			<code>shaderpacks</code> and more of a game installation of Life in the Woods Renaissance. Since 
			there are two different variants of game configurations, you may have 
			two different game installations in this folder: <code>LitWR.Basic</code> and <code>LitWR.Hungry</code> 
			(see Sections <a href="#GameVariant">Game Variant</a> for more). 
		</dl>
		
		<h2 id="Game">Install and Start a Game</h2>
		<p>When you start the launcher for the first time, it will be preconfigured 
			to install Minecraft and Life in the Woods Renaissance in variant Basic 
			without shaders in its local directory. You can start the installation 
			process by clicking on the <em>Install/Play</em> button in the footer 
			of the GUI (see Section <a href="#Interface">Interface</a>). When 
			the installation is finished the <em>Install/Play</em> button will
			change to <em>Play</em> and you can click it again to start the game.
		</p>
		<p>The following sections will explain the different game variants and 
			configurations you can chose for installation.</p>
		<h3 id="GameVariant">Game Variant</h3>
		<p>Life in the Woods Renaissance comes in two variants: Basic and Hungry. 
		Both refer basically to different levels difficulty based on 
		modifications of hunger and food/growth mechanics. Basic can be 
		considered as <em>standard</em> and Hungry as <em>difficult</em>.
		</p>
		<p>The variant selector (lower right corner in the GUI) selects the 
		variant you would like to install/play. You can have both installed 
		and switch between them but they will not share the same worlds. 
		When you connect to a server it is not necessary to select a specific
		variant, they are both compatible with certain variant running on the 
		server.
		</p>
		<h3 id="Configuration">Configuration</h3>
		<p>The configuration of a game variant can be viewed and edited in the 
			<em>Config</em> tab (see below). This section will explain the different 
			elements on the <em>Config</em> tab beginning at the top.
		</p>
		<div align="center"><img src="images/config-page.png"/></div>
		<h4 id="User">User</h4>
		<p>The launcher supports multiple user accounts. The drop down box allows
		    to switch between known user accounts. During installation, 
		    the launcher will copy the user accounts of your standard Minecraft 
		    installation and automatically select the one you have recently used.
		    If you would like to add another account, then chose the field 
		    "login on next start". The launcher will then open a login prompt
		    when you start the game.
		</p>
		
		<h4 id="WorkingDirectory">Working Directory</h4>
		<p>This field contains the path to the Minecraft working directory 
			(see also Section <a href="#Directories">Directories</a>). 
			You can change this path either by editing or via a click on 
			the folder icon to the right. </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			If you have chosen a folder which does not exist or do not contain a Minecraft
			installation, the launcher will create a new Minecraft installation at this location.</li>
			<li>If you have selected a path to 
			another Minecraft installation (e.g. your normal Minecraft installation), then 
			the launcher will detect it and install just missing files (such as the 
			required Forge version) and add profiles for the Life in the Woods Renaissance 
			games you have installed. In case you switch back to your 
			Minecraft installation, you will then have to select the profile you would 
			like to use in the lower left corner of the Minecraft launcher window.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			By default, the launcher will create its own Minecraft installation in 
			his local directory. This prevents the launcher from any 
			modifications or anomalies that might exist in your normal 
			Minecraft installation. However, one disadvantage for you might be
			that you have to login again every time you switch between 
			Life in the Woods Renaissance and your normal Minecraft installation. 
			You can fix that by selecting your normal Minecraft installation in 
			this field. The launcher will then share this installation with the 
			Minecraft launcher and you will only have to login again if the
			authentication token is expired.
		</p>	
		
		<h4 id="ConfigVariant">Variant</h4>
		<p>This field just displays the variant you have chosen with the 
			<a href="#Interface">variant selector</a> in the lower right 
			corner (footer) of the launcher GUI (see also Section 
			<a href="#GameVariant">Game Variant</a>).
		</p>
		<h4 id="ConfigVersion">Version</h4>
		<p> This field displays the version of the selected variant of the 
		    mod-pack which is either currently installed or will be installed 
		    when you hit the <em>Install/Play</em> button. In case you are 
		    installing the mod-pack for the first time, this field allows you
		    to chose one of the versions available on the update server. 
		    By default, the launcher will select the most recent version.
	    </p>
	    <p> Behind the version field is a radio button showing the text 
	        <em>Keep</em>. In case the update server offers a newer version
	        of the mod-pack, this button allows you to <em>keep</em> an already 
	        installed version until you decide to upgrade. This allows you to 
	        play with an older version until you think it is safe to upgrade.
			Also, when you first install a variant and select an older version, the 
	        launcher will automatically activate the <em>Keep</em> button.
	    </p>
	    <p> Once installed, you cannot downgrade a given version of the 
	        mod-pack (just not supported). In case you want to check if an upgrade
	        will be successful (considering an upgrade of a world you have used 
	        in an older version), then create a backup first: Copy the game folder
	        (see above) to a save location. If you decide to keep the older version
	        then copy the backup back to its original location and set the tick to 
	        <em>Keep</em> this version.
	    </p>
		<h4 id="ConfigProfile">Profile</h4>
		<p>This field displays the name of the profile which is also the default name of the game directory 
		(see Section <a href="#Directories">Directories</a>). 
		The name of the profile always consists of the prefix 
		<code>LitWR.</code> followed by the name of the variant. When you 
		share your Minecraft installation with the LitWR launcher, this profile will also 
		show up in the Minecraft launcher and you can safely start LitWR from there too.
		</p>
		<h4 id="ConfigGameDirectory">Game Directory</h4>
		<p>This field displays the game directory of the selected 
			LitWR variant (see Section <a href="#Directories">Directories</a>). 
			By default the launcher suggests a location for the game directory 
			in its local folder.
		</p>
		<p> You <em>can</em> chose a different location for the game directory here. 
		    In this case, please note that the game directory is specific for the 
		    selected game variant and version. Do not use the same game directory for
		    different variants. If you select an existing directory, the launcher 
		    will detect the version but not its variant.
		</p>
		<h4 id="JVMArguments">JVM Arguments</h4>
		<p>This field contains the arguments which will be given to 
		Java during start of the Minecraft client. When a game variant 
		has been selected for the first time, the launcher analyses your
		hardware and adjusts these arguments to optimise performance.
		</p>
		<p>
		JVM arguments have significant impact on the 
		performance and can cause the game to crash or not start at all. 
		You can always reset these arguments by clicking the 
		<em>Reset</em> button below.
		</p>
		<h4 id="OptionalFeatures"><u>Optional Features Section</u></h4>
		<p>
		Shader pack and some of the mods are optional and require 
		a seperate download. Thus they have got its own section on the config page. 
		Optional features include a shader and the mods ShaderModCore and OptiFine to 
		make the shader work, but also the mod DynamicLights, 
		which lets torches emit light while holding them in 
		your hand.
		</p>
		<p>
		If one of those optional features is selected, the 
		installation process will require you to download some 
		packages through your Internet browser. But don't worry, 
		the launcher will guide you and you will basically just 
		have to click buttons and links. 
		</p>
		<p>Features can be enabled or disabled which results in 
		   either installation or deinstallation. In case of 
		   changes to the current configuration the 
		   <em>Install/Play</em> button will reflect this by 
		   showing the text <em>Apply Changes</em>. A click on this
		   button will then execute the required operations to apply
		   the changes.
		</p>
		<h4 id="Shader">Shader</h4>
		<p> This field generally allows you to select one of the supported 
		    shaders or those shaders, you have manually installed. 
            The list of shaders is ordered by performance impact. 
		    The topmost are the lightest and the bottommost reduce 
		    FPS more. The empty field, or field <em>none</em> or 
		    <em>internal</em> represent Minecraft vanilla shading, i.e. no custom shaders. 
		</p>
		<p> When selecting a custom shader for the first, the launcher will 
		    automatically add all optional features as well. The 
		    ShadersMod is required by all shaders. Other features 
		    can be turned off in case your game runs better without them.
		</p>
		<p> To support the Streams mod (generates flowing rivers) shaders 
			are getting patched during the start of the Minecraft client. 
			We have added patches for Sildur's shaders only, which is the 
			main reason why we support just Sildur's shaders. You can always 
			add other shaders, but they will not shade streams unless you add 
			patches for them as well. Refer to Section 
			<a href="#HelperModShaderPatching">Shader Patching</a> 
			in order to learn how you can add support for your shader.
		</p>
		<p>Activation of shaders is twofold: It makes your game 
		look prettier (at least for most people) but it reduces 
		frames per second and game performance in general. 
		Reduced FPS can cause motion sickness for some people, 
		which you may experience as getting more or less dizzy. 
		It is not dangerous but uncomfortable. We tried to find good 
		general settings for the shaders we support but you 
		may still have to adjust them for your system. If this 
		is getting to fiddly or impossible, then just unselect the shader. Also, 
		you may have to deal with some shader/graphics card issues 
		that have been reported earlier. In this case refer to the 
		<a href="http://homac.cakelab.org/projects/litwrl/support/faq.html">FAQ</a> 
		to solve them.
		</p>
		<h4 id="ShadersMod">Shaders Mod</h4>
		<p>If this tick is set, the launcher will install the Shaders Mod which is 
		   required for all shaders.  In case a custom shader is selected, this tick
		   will be automatically set.
		</p>
		<h4 id="OptiFine">OptiFine</h4>
		<p>
		OptiFine improves game performance even if you are not using shaders. 
		</p>
		
		<h4 id="DynamicLights">Dynamic Lights</h4>
		<p>
		This is a mod, which lets items emit light, even when you hold them in 
		your hands wear them on your head or drop them on the floor. Downside 
		is, that it can be quite resource intensive.
		</p>
		<h4 id="ResetButton"><em>Reset</em> Button</h4>
		<p>The reset button resets the JVM arguments and the Shader to its default settings.
			In case of the JVM arguments, that means that the launcher will reassess your 
			hardware which might come handy in case you have added memory for example.
		</p>


		
		<h1 id="HelperMod">Helper Mod</h1>
		The helper mod does a couple of things which can't be achieved by just 
		adding configurations to the mod-pack:
		<dl>
		<dt>Modifications to <code>RuinsPositionsFile.txt</code></dt>
		<dd>The Ruins mod maintains a database of generated ruins in the world save 
			folder (<code>RuinsPositionsFile.txt</code>). The helper mod allows to add 
			a standard entry to this database each time a new world is created. 
			<br/><em>Available on server and client side.</em>
		</dd>
		<dt>Default World Type</dt>
		<dd>LitWR uses Biomes O'Plenty as default world generator. To prevent confusion, 
			the mod promotes Biomes O'Plenty to be the default world type. 
			Users don't need to select the world type manually and the Biomes O'Plenty 
			reminder notification can be suppressed. 
			<br/><em>Available on server and client side.</em>
		</dd>
		<dt>Solves Key Binding Conflict</dt>
		<dd>OptiFine provides a zoom or binocular function. The default key for this 
			functionality unfortunately conflicts with the default key binding for sprinting 
			(<code>left CTRL</code>). The mod detects this conflict and solves it by 
			remapping the zoom key to <code>Z</code>.
			<br/><em>Available on client side only.</em> 
		</dd>
		<dt>Shader Patching</dt>
		<dd>As explained in Section <a href="#Shader">Shader</a>, shaders have to be patched
			to support the streams mod. The mod provides a method to patch shaders 
			dynamically (see Section <a href="#HelperModShaderPatching">Shader Patching</a> for details).
			<br/><em>Available on client side only.</em> 
		</dd>
		<dt>LitWR Main Menu</dt>
		<dd>The mod also adds the LitWR logo and theme music to the main menu.
			<br/><em>Available on client side only.</em> 
		</dd>
		</dl>
		<h2 id="HelperModConfiguration">Configuration</h2>
		<p>The helper mod uses a configuration file at the standard location suggested by Forge, which is:</p>
		<pre>
		<code>&lt;game directory&gt;/config/litwr.cfg</code>
		</pre>
		<p><em>Please note that there is another configuration <code>litwr-launcher.cfg</code> which 
			belongs to the launcher only.</em>
		</p>
		<p>If the configuration file does not exist, it is created at the first start of the Minecraft launcher 
			and populated with default values. The configuration file may contain the following properties:</p>
		<dl>
		<dt><code>B:displayLitwrLabel</code></dt>
		<dd>
			Boolean value, which controls whether the LitWR logo will be displayed in the main menu or not.
			<br/>Default: <code>true</code>
			<br/>Side(s): Client
		</dd>
		<dt><code>B:exchangeDefaultWorldType</code></dt>
		<dd>
			Flag, which controls whether the default world type will be exchanged
			with the one given in property <code>S:newDefaultWorldType</code>.
			<br/>Default: <code>true</code>
			<br/>Affected Side(s): Client and Server
		</dd>

		<h2 id="HelperModShaderPatching">Shader Patching</h2>
		<p>Based on block IDs, shaders decide which function they 
			apply to shade blocks. For example many shaders differentiate
			between plants and solid blocks and manipulate the shape of 
			plants to let them look like they are waving in the wind. 
			Another example are water blocks which are shaded differently
			to apply reflections to the water surface.
		</p>
		<p>Obviously, the shader can't shade blocks properly if it does 
			not know the given block ID. Streams is a mod, which adds flowing 
			rivers. To visualise the flow, streams adds a bunch of new blocks. 
			Because those new blocks are unknown to the shader, they are not
			shaded.
		</p>
		<p>A practical approach to solve this issue is, to determine the 
			missing block IDs and add them to the branch, where the shader decides
			whether a block is water or not.
		</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, the IDs of blocks introduced by mods, are 
			issued dynamically by the mod loader (i.e. Forge). Thus, in different 
			installations of the same mod, the IDs of its introduced blocks may be 
			different. This means, the modifications made to the shader in one 
			installation will not work in another installation.
		</p>
		<p>To overcome this issue, the helper mod of LitWR introduces a functionality
			to patch shaders at the start of the client using a preprocessor. The 
			preprocessor scans so-called <em>shader patch template files</em> for 
			specific <em>preprocessor statements</em> and exchanges them by 
			dynamically generated strings based on the installation and environment 
			of the running Minecraft client instance.
		</p>
		<h3>Procedure</h3>
		<p>On each start the dynamic shader patch instance runs the following 
			tasks for thoses shaders in folder "shaderpacks" which have 
		 a corresponding template patch file folder in 
		 <code>mods/resouces/litwr/shaderpatch</code>:</p>
		<ol>
		<li><b>Backup:</b> If it not already exists, a backup of
		the original shaderpack is stored in "mods/resources/litwr/shaderpatch/backups".
		</li>
		<li><b>Unpack Original:</b> The original shaderpack from the backup location is
		unpacked to a temporary working directory.
		</li>
		<li><b>Preprocess Patch Templates:</b> The shader pack's template patch files folder 
		gets fed to the preprocessor. Its result is written to the temporary working 
		directory in order to <b>override</b> existing original shader files.
		</li>
		<li><b>Install Patched Shaderpack:</b> When preprocessing is successfully 
		finished, the result is packed again (zip) and moved back to the shaderpacks 
		folder, <b>replacing</b> the shaderpack with the same name.
		</li>
		<li><b>Reinitialise Shader:</b> If the shaderpack was already loaded, it will be
		forced to unload and reinitialise with the patched shaderpack.
		</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h3>Patch Template Files</h3>
		<p>
		Patch template files are shader files which contain modifications
		in respect to the original shader file. Those modifications can for 
		example be added preprocessor statements which will be replaced later 
		on by the preprocessor (thus, the name patch template). 
		Patch template files <b>replace</b> shader files at the same location
		in the shaderpack. Additional shader files will be copied to the 
		patched shader pack as well.
		</p>
		<p>
		A patch template file <code>T</code> for a given shader file <code>O</code> 
		of the shader pack <code>P</code> has to be stored in the folder 
		<code>mods/resources/litwr/shaderpatch/P/T</code> to replace the shader
		file <code>shaderpacks/P/O</code>.
		</p>
		<h4>Example:</h4>
		The shader pack <code>Sildurs Vibrant Shader Medium 1.13.zip</code> contains
		a shader file <code>shaders/gbuffers_water.vsh</code>. To replace this file
		we place the modified version of it in the following path:
		<code>mods/resources/litwr/shaderpatch/Sildurs Vibrant Shader Medium 1.13.zip/shaders/gbuffers_water.vsh</code>.
		Please note, that the modified shader is located in a folder even though the
		folder has the postfix <code>.zip</code>.
		
		<h3>Preprocessor Statements</h3>
		Every line starting with <code>&#47;*#spp-</code> and ending with <code>*&#47;</code> 
		is considered as a preprocessor statement. The preprocessor will replace the 
		entire line when it gets processed. Thus, any other code in the same line including and after 
		<code>*&#47;</code> will be discarded!
		
		<h4>Syntax:</h4>
		<table border="1">
		<tr>
		<td><em>statement</em></td><td><code><b>&#47;*#spp-</b></code><em>command</em><code><b>*&#47;</b></code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td><em>command</em></td><td><code><b>paste</b> </code><em>parameter</em> | <code><b>call</b></code> <em>methodcall</em></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td><em>methodcall</em></td><td><em>method</em> <code><b>(</b></code> <em>parameters</em> <code><b>)</b></code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td><em>method</em></td><td><code><b>getBlockIds</b></code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td><em>parameters</em></td><td><em>parameter</em>[<b>, </b><em>parameters</em>]</td>
		</tr>
		</table>
		
		<h4>Commands</h4>
		The following commands are supported:
		<table border="1">
		<tr>
		<th>Command</th><th>Meaning</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td><code><b>paste</b></code> <em>parameter</em></td><td>Replace the line with the string following the paste command.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td><code><b>call</b></code> <em>methodcall</em></td><td>Replace the line with the result of the following <em>methodcall</em>.</td>
		</tr>
		</table>
		
		<h4>Methods</h4>
		<p>Methods are actual methods of objects in the Java code of the mod. 
		The following methods are supported:
		</p>
		<table border="1">
		<tr>
		<th>Method</th><th>Parameters</th><th>Meaning</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td><code><b>getBlockIds</b></code></td><td>String <em>blockNameSubstring</em>,<br/>String <em>separator</em></td><td>This method searches the block registry for blocks with a block name containing the given <em>blockNameSubstring</em>. 
		It concatenates the block IDs of found blocks in a string using the string <em>separator</em> as separator between ids.</td>
		</tr>
		</table>
		
		
		<h4>Example:</h4>
		This example shows how to add shader preprocessor results without
		breaking the actual shader code. If the preprocessor is not present
		to replace the requested lines, the shader can still run.
		
		<pre>
		if (mc_Entity == 8 || mc_Entity == 9 
		&#47;*#spp-paste " || mc_Entity == "*&#47;
		&#47;*#spp-call getBlockIds("streams:river/tile.water", "|| mc_Entity == ")*&#47;
		) {

		<h2 id="VanillaLauncher">Switch to Vanilla Minecraft Launcher</h2>
		<p>In case you need certain features not supported by the LitWR Launcher 
		   you can easily switch to the vanilla Minecraft Launcher following this guide. 
		</p>
		<p>By default the launcher creates its own Minecraft installation to keep things separated.
		   The easiest way to switch to the vanilla Launcher is to use the vanilla Minecraft 
		   installation instead.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Start the LitWR Launcher</li>
			<li>On its config tab change the <a href="#WorkingDirectory">working directory</a> 
			    to point to the vanilla Minecraft directory.</li>
			<li>Hit the <a href="#Interface">Install</a> button. This will install the required 
			    Minecraft version and Forge in your vanilla Minecraft directory and creates 
			    a profile entry according to your current settings.</li>
			<li>Close the LitWR launcher.</li>
			<li>Start the vanilla Minecraft launcher.</li>
			<li>In the lower left corner of the window, select the LitWR profile which was 
			    created by the installation. The name of the profile depends on the game 
			    variant you have chosen, i.e. <em>LitWR.Basic</em> or <em>LitWR.Hungry</em>.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You can now start and configure the game with the vanilla Minecraft launcher.</p>

		<h2>Downloads</h2>
		<p>The launcher communicates with various source on the Internet to receive files. 
		To prevent injection of malicious code, the launcher does checksum check on 
		downloaded files where possible. An exception are for example Sildur's shaders, because
		they update from time to time without changing its version number 
		and/or download location. Thus, we cannot do checksum checks without breaking 
		the download when the shader was updated.
		</p>
		<h2>Open Source</h2>
		<p>The launcher is open source. Everybody can 
		review the source code <a href="http://homac.cakelab.org/projects/litwrl">here</a>.	This guarantees that no one can add 
		malicious code or spy functionalities without other people 
		getting aware of it.
