GUIDELINES FOR THE NAME, BRAND AND ASSETS OF ANY OF OUR GAMES
=============================================================


All of our games are really important to us and to our community, 
which means that lots of you want to use our Brands and the things 
around our games to do cool stuff. We‘re happy about that. 
Sometimes, however, people go too far and do things that make 
the community think that their products and services are connected 
with or endorsed by us or even produced by us. We are not happy 
about that. Especially when people do it deliberately to take 
unfair advantage of the community and our work in that way. When 
that happens, fans buy things thinking they are official which 
they are not. That means we can't control quality etc. which 
diminishes the value of the work we have done and the trust that 
our community have in what we do.

We don‘t want you to stop doing the cool stuff that you do and 
so these Guidelines are intended to help everyone understand what 
we consider to be fair and unfair use of our “Brands” and “Assets”. 
We've had some help from some lawyers and they will also help us 
if we need to take further steps to protect our rights but the 
purpose of these “Guidelines” is to give some clarity on what 
you can do without having to contact us (or our lawyers) - and 
what you mustn‘t do or else we (or our lawyers) will have to 
contact you. We hope you understand.


GUIDELINES
==========
These Guidelines cover the use of our Brands and our Assets. For 
these purposes, therefore when we refer to:

  - a Name what we mean is the name of any one of our games as well 
    as any names which are confusingly similar to the names of any 
    of our games;
  - our Brands what we mean is any Names and the related logos and 
    distinctive characteristics of any of our games;
  - our Assets what we mean is the code, software, graphics, 
    textures, sound and audio from any of our games and any videos 
    or screenshots taken from or our games.

These Guidelines apply in addition to and not in place of our 
Account Terms or EULAs. Please remember that we say in all of our 
EULA that we have one major rule about our games and that is: Do 
not distribute anything we've made – which means don‘t

  - give copies of our games to anyone else;
  - make commercial use of anything we've made;
  - try to make money from anything we've made; or
  - let other people get access to anything we‘ve made in a way 
    that is unfair or unreasonable;

unless we specifically agree to it or allow it under these Guidelines.

These Guidelines do not change that principle but are intended to 
help people understand what we expect and want.

Please also check back here from time to time because we will update 
these guidelines and provide further guidance.


ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS
======================
The first thing to say is that there are the following Essential 
Requirements that apply to all use of the our Brands (which include 
any Names) and our Assets. If you are allowed to use any part of any 
Name, any of our Brands and / or any of our Assets then what you are 
doing MUST:

  - NOT make people think that you or what your are doing is 
    official; approved or endorsed by us; or associated or connected 
    with us;
  - NOT be unlawful, deceptive, obscene, harmful or disparaging;
  - NOT adversely affect any of our Brands or any of our Assets;
  - NOT include anything else around it that makes people think 
    that you or what your are doing is official; approved or endorsed 
    by us; or associated or connected with us;
  - comply with the relevant Account Terms/EULA;
    sufficiently differentiate the use of any Name you are using from
    any other branding;

These are the "Essential Requirements".


WHAT YOU CAN DO
===============
Non-Commercial Things
---------------------
We are very relaxed about things you do for yourself. Pretty much 
anything goes there - so go for it and have fun just don‘t distribute 
anything we've made etc.

We are also quite relaxed about other non-commercial things so feel 
free to create and share videos, screen shots, independently created 
mods (that don't use any of our Assets), fan art, machinima etc;

However if you want to use any Name in the title of a product that 
you distribute or service that you provide (even if it is for free) 
then you have to:

  - follow the Essential Requirements;
  - do so in a way that honestly and fairly describes those things 
    or the purpose of them; and
  - ensure that the Name (which includes any confusingly similar 
    name) is not the first word and don‘t use any other aspect of 
    any of our Brands or Assets as part of any related branding, 
    including as or as part of any logo.

This applies especially if you want to set up and run blogs, servers, 
community forums, fan sites, fan clubs, news groups, events and 
gatherings.


Commercial Things
-----------------
We are less relaxed about commercial things. You may not therefore 
use any Names in or as the main name or title of commercial things.

You may use a Name as a secondary name or title if you:

  - do so because it is necessary to honestly and fairly describe 
    those things or the purpose of them:
  - follow the Essential Requirements;
  - ensure that the Name (which includes any confusingly similar 
    name) is not the dominant element or the distinctive part of 
    the complete name or title of what you are doing;
  - don‘t use any other aspect of any of our Brands or Assets as 
    part of any related branding, including as or as part of any 
    logo.

To help you we‘ve suggested the following examples:

    "The Shaft – a Minecraft podcast" (we‘re cool with that).
    "Minecraft - the ultimate help app" (we‘re NOT cool with that)

You may not make any other commercial use of any of our Brands or 
Assets for example you may not sell any merchandise that uses any 
of our Brands or Assets and you definitely may not use our Names 
as keywords or search tags for products that have no relationship 
with them.

We love the idea of people doing cool things with our games and 
sharing those things with the community. That's something we totally 
support and encourage. So please feel free to do so but please also 
make sure you don‘t go too far.

In addition to the Brand Guidelines above we also have the following 
Asset Usage Guidelines that are intended to help you and everyone 
else understand what we consider to be fair and unfair – what you
can and cannot do.
 
 
Commerical Usage Guidelines
---------------------------
The One Major Rule still applies but we may make some exceptions 
and they will be listed here, in this policy.

In this policy we will also give some additional specifics of what 
you may not do. However if something is not mentioned here it 
involves making money using anything from Minecraft (or anything 
else we've made) please do not do it.

In addition to the specifics set out below, where we do allow you 
to do something you will always need to add a credit as follows:

    Minecraft ®/TM & © 2009-2013 Mojang / Notch


Videos and Screenshots
----------------------
You are allowed to put footage of our Game on YouTube or any other
 website. In fact, we like you doing so.

You may create, use and distribute videos of you playing or using 
our Game for any lawful reason provided that you don't make any 
money from them.

You may make money using your videos of our Game so, for instance 
by putting ads on them, as long as you also add your own unique 
content to the video, such as audio commentary. The amount you 
add must also be enough to make it fair and worthwhile for someone 
to pay for it or for you to make money from it. For example you 
couldn‘t just include your logo, web address or indent but you 
could add an audio commentary or your own music if you are creating 
a music video.

You may also make money using videos and screen-shots if it is 
covered by so called “fair dealing” or “fair use” exceptions to 
copyright, such as where it is for criticism and review, reporting 
current affairs etc. In each case, you will still need to add 
appropriate additional content and credits where applicable.

…more will follow as and when we decide what to add - so feel free 
to make requests.

If something isn‘t covered by these Guidelines that probably means 
we don‘t want you to do it. In any case if it isn‘t covered please 
don‘t do it without getting permission from us. You can contact us 
at brands at mojang.com. If something is specifically covered and 
permitted by these Guidelines, our Account Terms or EULAs applicable 
to any of our games then you don‘t need to contact us.
