		<h3>OPEN</h3>
		<dl>
		<dt id="0022">[BUG:022] Game Crashes with: "Error: Already Tesselating!"</dt>
		<dd>This is most probably the result of a race condition. 
			<br/>Currently getting investigated. 
			<br/>Status: OPEN
		</dd>
		<dt id="0009">[BUG:009] See-through on Different Objects with Shaders Enabled</dt>
		<dd>This is a confirmed bug for ATI graphics cards with Sildurs shaders 
		    in version 1.13. 
			<br/>Current solution: See <a href="faq.html#0009">FAQ</a>
			<br/>Status: OPEN
		</dd>
		<dt id="0020">[BUG:020] Any text is garbled/ overlaying on the help page / news page.</dt>
		<dd>
		<br/>Analysis so far: Neither character encoding, font cache nor CSS related.
		<br/>Status: OPEN
		</dd>
		<dt id="0012">[FRQ:012] Shader Installation Procedure Confusing</dt>
		<dd>Installation procedure causes confusion due to the following reasons:
			<ul>
			<li>Steps of the installation are not explained.</li>
			<li>Popup dialog which notifies about the next step fails to raise to the 
			    top of the window hierarchy.</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>Analysis: Second item can't be fixed (Java/Windows issue)
			<br/>Status: OPEN
		</dd>
		<dt id="0015">[FRQ:015] Can't change the games folder on config tab</dt>
		<dd>This feature is just not yet supported.
		<br/>Status: OPEN
		</dd>
		<dt id="0016">[FRQ:016] Have to relogin when switching to Minecraft</dt>
		<dd>When switching between Minecraft installations and Life in the Woods 
			Renaissance, the user needs to relogin, because the authentication 
			token is no longer valid.
		<br/>Possible fix: Copy authentication token from Minecraft directory.
		<br/>Workaround: Share Minecraft directory with Minecraft launcher (see <a href="faq.html#0016">FAQ</a>)
			 or create another user account in OS.
		<br/>Status: OPEN

		<h3>CLOSED</h3>
		<dl>
		<dt id="0019">[BUG:019] Shader Patch not Working and Shader Package 0kb</dt>
		<dd>Two issues: Patching fails and rollback fails (which should fix the first).<br/>
			Needs analysis.
		<br/>FIXED: (1) Java canonical file names converts long file names to 8.3 format, which lead errors during compression.
		<br/>FIXED: (2) Undeleted left overs in temp folder lead to shader files merged with previously processed shaders.
		<br/>Status: CLOSED
		</dd>
		<dt id="0017">[BUG:017] Corrupted Package Descriptor After Interrupted Download</dt>
		<dd>Occurs if the download of the package descriptor was interrupted by a timeout.
		<br/>FIXED: Fix prevents corrupted package to be stored and deletes detected 
			corrupted package descriptors. Missing package descriptors will be fetched 
			with the next try.
		<br/>Workaround: Delete local repository cache 
		(see <a href="faq.html#0017">FAQ</a>).
		<br/>Status: CLOSED
		</dd>

			<br/>FIX: Installation script prevents usage of Java 1.6
			<br/>Status: CLOSED
		</dd>
		<dt id="0006">[FRQ:006] Launcher needs a proper manual</dt>
		<dd>People can't find folders <code>saves</code>, <code>screenshots</code> etc.
			<br/>Current solution: See <a href="faq.html#0006">FAQ</a>
			<br/>FIX: manual now available
			<br/>Status: CLOSED
		</dd>
		<dt id="0001">[BUG:001] Launcher Does not Start After Java Update</dt>
		<dd>The desktop shortcut contains the full qualified path to the Java
			executable which changes with each Java update.
			<br/>Current solution: Run the installation script again.
			<br/>FIX: v1.2.3: launch script determines best java installation dynamically.
			<br/>Status: CLOSED
		</dd>
		<dt id="0002">[FRQ:002] Batchfile Instead of JScript Installation Script</dt>

			<br/>Status: CLOSED

		<dt id="0003">[BUG:003] Flickering with Shaders Enabled</dt>
		<dd>Issue is caused by multi-threaded chunk loading and was 
		    reported for NVidea graphics cards only.
			<br/>Solution: See <a href="faq.html#0003">FAQ</a>.
			<br/>Status: CLOSED
		</dd>
		<dt id="0010">[BUG:010] Log contains "[error] java.io.IOException: Stream closed"</dt>
		<dd>This "error" message basically means, that Minecraft or Forge or any mods
			are still writing to the log (file) while it has already been
			closed due to a shutdown. 
			<br/>
			This is not caused by the launcher and does not mean any
			harm to your system or files.
			<br/>Solution: Ignore it.
			<br/>Status: CLOSED
		</dd>
		<dt id="0011">[BUG:011] Checksum Error when Installing Extreme Shader</dt>
		<dd>Checksum was correct on server side and successfully validated on 
			client side by the developer. Issue vanished after reinstall and 
			the actual reason has never been found.
			<br/>
			<br/>Status: CLOSED
		</dd>
		<dt id="0013">[BUG:013] Game Crashes with "NullPointerException" or "Ticking Memory .."</dt>
		<dd>Originally, it is a memory issue (meaning the JVM doesn't get
			enough memory or can't free memory fast enough).
			The issue is most probably caused by the world generator - at least it occurs
			always during chunk loading. The launcher maximises the memory
			size given to Minecraft according to the memory size of your system
			to minimise the possibility of this issue to occur, but it still happens occasionally.
			There is no way we could fix it but you can significantly reduce 
			the probability of this issue by using the following workarounds suggested. 
			<br/>
			Workarounds: See <a href="faq.html#0013">FAQ</a><br/>
