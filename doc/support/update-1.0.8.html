		<h2 style="text-align: center">Mod-Pack Update 1.0.8</h2>
		<p style="text-align: center">28/02/2016</p>
		<br/>
		<p>This update focuses on improvements/fixes in respect to shaders 
			and minor bug-fixes to secret buildings. The update process requires a
			removal of existing mods and configurations. Those who made changes to 
			folders <code>mods</code> and <code>config</code> will have to create
			backups or make notes before they upgrade. Existing save games and 
			other game settings will be unaffected from the update.
		</p>
		<h3>Fixed Bug in Shader Patching Feature</h3>
		<p>
			First of all, the shader patching feature was introduced to enable the
			shader to handle generated rivers properly. Rivers contain new water 
			block types which are unknown to the shader usually. Thus, with Sildurs
			permission, we added a function in our helper mod, which modifies the 
			shader to support those new block types. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, this function ran in two different obstacles on Windows
			systems and then scrambled the shader instead of patching it. This is
			now fixed and additionally the function was improved to be able to 
			successfully revert the shader to its original state in case anything
			goes wrong.
		</p>
		<h3>Updates of OptiFine and ShaderModCore</h3>
		<p>Overall shader performance suffered from outdated versions of 
			OptiFine and ShaderModCore. Thus, this update also brings the new 
			versions of both. When upgrading you will be prompted to download
			the new versions through your browser (same way as before).
		</p>
		<h3>Turn off Multi-Core Chunk Loading!</h3>
		<p>We noticed that <code>Multi-Core Chunk Loading</code> 
			(see Minecraft <code>Video Settings</code>) causes flickering.
			Flickering vanishes when you switch between different chunk
			loading modes and you can even return to multi-core but it 
			always comes back when you restart Minecraft.</p>
		<p>
			We thought the update of OptiFine and ShaderModCore will also fix 
			the flickering issue, but unfortunately it doesn't. Based on various bug
			reports, we have received, we now believe that there
			is is an incompatibility between OptiFine and the Forge 
			version required by LitWR, which can even cause more sever 
			issues like crashes due to inconsistencies in Mincraft's 
			rendering sub-system, corruption during world generation 
			and even in save games. Thus, we would like to ask everybody 
			to turn off <code>Multi-Core</code> <code>Chunk Loading</code> in 
			<code>Video Settings</code>, but we didn't want to force it 
			because it is still a hypothesis.
		</p>
		<h3>Fixes and Changes to Secrets</h3>
		<p>These changes are related to buildings injected in the ruins 
			spawning system. Those changes have no effect on already generated 
			(existing) ruins in saved games. Obviously, we can't give more 
			details on that	without spoiling secrets.
		</p>
		<h3>Another Update Planned</h3>
		<p>
			Phedran plans another update which brings at least three recently
			updated mods with new content, some bug fixes, and improvements to 
			some game mechanics. (Those changes are not related to crickets! 
			BTW.: Reading some documentation about gardening might help with 
			crickets ;)
		</p>
		<p>This next update will take some time, because we may have to update forge
			as well and then we will have to test everything together and decide
			if we can provide save game upgrades easily or have to find other 
			solutions. So, do not expected it to soon.
		</p>
