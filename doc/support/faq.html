		<dt id="0020">Launcher does not start</dt>
		<dd>Make sure, you start the Launcher with Java 1.8. 
		Java 1.9 is not supported - neither by the Modpack nor by the launcher.
		</dd>
		<dt id="0019">Game Crashes After NVidia's Driver Update</dt>
		<dd>Several players report immediate client crashes when launching LitWR on Win10 having an NVidia graphics card. This issue is apparently caused by a recent NVidia graphics driver update.
		    <br/><br/>
		    There are two methods to fix it:
		    <ol>
			    <li><b>Method:</b> The quickfix solution: Rollback to last driver version 
			    (see <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/object/driver_rollback.html">here</a> 
			    or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ3tPjeQ8PI)">here</a>.</li>
			    <li><b>Method:</b> An actual solution but not yet confirmed to solve it: 
			    Do a clean install of the graphics driver (uninstall/reinstall also 
			    explained <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/object/driver_rollback.html">here</a>).</li>
			</ol>
		</dd>
		<dt id="0018">Game Crashes Instantly After Start (Game ended with bad state (exit code 1))</dt>
		<dd>Use the installation script for your system which comes
			with the downloaded zip file. It will check if 
			you have the correct Java version for your system and 
			tell you which one you need. It is in particular important 
			to have <b>Java 64bit</b> for <b>64bit systems</b> and 
			<b>Java 32bit</b> for <b>32bit systems</b>.
			Refer to the <a href="../manual/index.html#Installation">manual</a> 
			for detailed installation instructions.
		</dd>
		<dt id="0003">Flickering Chunks (with and without shaders) on NVIDEA Graphics Cards</dt>
		<dd>Issue is caused by multi-core chunk loading which is not supported by some NVIDEA cards.
			We also believe that multi-core chunk loading causes crashes and inconsistent save games.
			<br/>Working solutions found so far:<br/>
			<ol>
			<li>Update graphics card driver.</li>
			<li>Adjustment of NVidea settings (not Minecraft):
			<ul>
				<li>turn <code>Threaded Optimization</code> or <code>OpenGL Optimization</code> off and</li>
				<li>turn <code>Vertical Sync</code> to on.</li>
			</ul>
			See also <a href="http://optifine.net/faq">OptiFine FAQs</a>.
			</li>
			<li>If (1) and (2) are not satisfying, go in <code>Options -> Video Settings</code> and set <code>Chunk Loading</code> to either <code>Default</code> or <code>Smooth</code>. 
			This is a reliable solution because it solves the root cause but that reduces FPS, too.</li>
			</ol>
		</dd>
		<dt id="0006">I cannot find the folders <code>saves</code>, <code>screenshots</code> etc.</dt>
		<dd>The LitWR launcher creates a separate installation of Minecraft and
			all required mods in <code>&lt;your-home-folder&gt;/.litwrl</code>.
			This folder contains subfolders:
			<ul>
			<li><code>games</code>
				<ul>
				<li>LitWR.Basic</li>
				<li>LitWR.Hunger</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>etc. ..</li>
			</ul>
			Depending on which LitWR variant you are playing (<em>Basic</em> or <em>Hungry</em>) 
			you will find all those folders in these two directories.
		</dd>
		<dt id="0013">Game Crashes with "NullPointerException" or "Ticking Memory .."</dt>
		<dd>Originally, it is a memory issue (meaning the JVM doesn't get
			enough memory or can't free memory fast enough).
			The issue is most probably caused by the world generator - at least it occurs
			always during chunk loading. The launcher maximises the memory
			size given to Minecraft according to the memory size of your system
			to minimise the possibility of this issue to occur, but it still happens occasionally.
			There is no way we could fix it but you can significantly reduce 
			the probability of this issue by using the following workarounds. 
			<br/>
			Workarounds (multiple choices):<br/>
			<ul>
			<li>Close other applications which consume lots of memory
			(this improves memory availability especially during start).</li>
			<li>When you experience significant lag, then wait until the world around you
				has been generated properly (especially in creative mode when flying over
				the world).</li>
			<li>Reduce <code>Video Settings -> Render Distance</code> to 12 or lower.</li>
			<li>Reduce <code>Video Settings -> Fog Start</code>.</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>
		<dt id="0016">I have to relogin each time I switch from a different Minecraft installation</dt>
		<dd>The launcher can share the Minecraft directory with your usual Minecraft installation. 
			In this case you will not have to relogin when you switch between Life in 
			the Woods Renaissance and your usual Minecraft installation (see also Section <a href="http://homac.cakelab.org/projects/litwrl/manual/index.html#Configuration">Configuration</a> in the user manual).<br/>
		</dd>
		<dt id="0021">How can I switch between different Mojang accounts?</dt>
		<dd>See config tab in the launcher.
		</dd> 
		<dt id="0017">How Can I Restart the Installation?</dt>
		<dd>Remove the launchers local cache (repository).<br/> 
			It is located in your home directory:<br/>
			<b>Windows:</b><br/>
			<code>
				C:\Users\&lt;your-login&gt;\.litwrl\repository
			</code>
			<br/><b>MacOS:</b><br/>
			<code>
				/Users/&lt;your-login&gt;/.litwrl/repository
			</code>
			<br/><b>Linux:</b><br/>
			<code>
				/home/&lt;your-login&gt;/.litwrl/repository
			</code>
