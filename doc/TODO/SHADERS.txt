DISCLAIMER: This software is still work in progress. See TODO.txt!






Shader packs get a meta-package called shaders in 

   meta/shaders/1.0.0
   
   
This meta-package has a package descriptor with the following content:



{
 "name": "Shader Packs",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "required": [
    "thirdparty/shadermod/2.3.28"
    "thirdparty/optifine/HD_U_A4"
  ],
  "optional": [
  	"thirdparty/shader/sildurs/1.0.8_Light",
  	"thirdparty/shader/sildurs/1.0.8_Medium",
  	"thirdparty/shader/sildurs/1.0.8_High",
  ]
}


Referenced mods and shaders get added as usual.

The Mod-pack will be extended by an optional section
with a reference on the shaders package.


{
  "filename": "LifeInTheWoodsRenaissanceClientBasic.zip", 
  "name": "Life in the Woods Renaissance Client Basic", 
  "checksum": "20829d24e6f2ede2bdbd008b31bc5b4c", 
  "downloadUrl": "file:///home/homac/tmp/repository/client/basic/1.0.1/LifeInTheWoodsRenaissanceClientBasic.zip", 
  "location": "client/basic/1.0.1", 
  "version": "1.0.1", 
  "required": [
    "thirdparty/minecraft/client/1.7.10", 
    "thirdparty/forge/1.7.10-10.13.2.1230"
  ],
  "optional": [
  	"meta/shaders/1.0.0"
  ]
}



All of the files needed are available via ad.fly links. To support this we have to 
open an external browser with the link.

Thus, the package descriptor gets extended by a flag


   downloadExternal : true
   


During installation or abort the setup service will then open a dialog
which tells the user that we are going to open a browser and which
exactly file he has to download.

The dialog will have the following elements:
+ a button "Download" which opens the external browser.
+ a file selector, which is used to locate the downloaded file
+ a cancel button to skip the installation of shaders

The downloaded file will be checked on filename and checksum
and the installation will proceed.

All downloads will be stored in the local repository.



SETTINGS:

+ Clouds OFF
+ Clouds Shadow OFF
+ OpenGL Fast
+ tweakBlockDamage ON
+ OldLighting OFF
+ Render Distance: max 16
+ Memory to max available
